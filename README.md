# ELIMINATORS
This is an ongoing project in order to ease finding the physical location of the office of the professors of our university:KIIT. You can currently look up the names and email addresses of the faculties on our app. 

we wish to integrate a geospatial mapping of the offices of the faculties (which is more than 2500 in our university spread across 6000 acres of our university area) and help students save time:)


  

#Total strength of kiit students are around 20K and with faculties are also very large.<br>
#Suppose we want to find the faculty location sitting in which department and at which floor and student is also confused with whom to interact for guidance so its best for a student can avail the information easily so we are planning to build anAPP(API) that holds such information.. <br>
#We  strongly believe that it will not only help the students, but also the parents and teachers as well.
