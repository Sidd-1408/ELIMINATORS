# ELIMINATORS
This is an ongoing project in order to ease finding the physical location of the office of the professors of our university:KIIT. You can currently look up the names and email addresses of the faculties on our app. 

we wish to integrate a geospatial mapping of the offices of the faculties (which is more than 2500 in our university spread across 6000 acres of our university area) and help students save time:)
